 # Scenario

 In this scenario, you need to obtain information contained in server log and user data files. You also need to find files with specific names.
Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and return the error messages in the server_logs.txt file. Next, you’ll navigate to the users directory and search for files that contain a specific string in their names. Finally, you’ll search for information contained in user files.

### Search for error messages in a log file

In this task, you must navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory and report on the error messages in the server_logs.txt file. You’ll do this by using grep to search the file and output only the entries that are for errors.

1.	Navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory.
   
    The command to complete this step:

  	```cd logs```

2. Use grep to filter the server_logs.txt file, and return all lines containing the text string error.

   ```grep error server_logs.txt```

   This grep command will filter server_logs.txt file, and return a list of the lines that match the text string error.

### Find files containing specific strings

1.	Navigate to the /home/analyst/reports/users directory.

    The command to complete this step:

cd /home/analyst/reports/users

2. Using the pipe character (|), pipe the output of the ls command to the grep command to list only the files containing the string Q1 in their names.

   The command to complete this step:
   
   ```ls | grep Q1```
