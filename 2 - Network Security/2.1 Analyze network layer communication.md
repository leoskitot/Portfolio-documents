# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Analyze Network Layer Communication

### Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT consultant services. Several customers contacted your 
company to report that they were not able to access the company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port 
unreachable” after waiting for the page to load.

You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you visit the 
website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage 
again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response 
returned to your host, the results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.”

In the DNS and ICMP log, you find the following information:

1.	The first two lines of the log file show the initial outgoing request from your computer to the DNS server requesting the IP address of yummyrecipesforme.com. This request is sent in a UDP packet.
2.	The third and fourth lines of the log show the response to your UDP packet. In this case, the ICMP 203.0.113.2 line is the start of the error message indicating that the UDP packet was undeliverable to port 53 of the DNS server.
3.	In front of each request and response, you find timestamps that indicate when the incident happened. In the log, this is the first sequence of numbers displayed: 13:24:32.192571. This means the time is 1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds.
4.	After the timestamps, you will find the source and destination IP addresses. In the first line, where the UDP packet travels from your browser to the DNS server, this information is displayed as: 192.51.100.15 > 203.0.113.2.domain. The IP address to the left of the greater than (>) symbol is the source address, which in this example is your computer’s IP address. The IP address to the right of the greater than (>) symbol is the destination IP address. In this case, it is the IP address for the DNS server: 203.0.113.2.domain. For the ICMP error response, the source address is 203.0.113.2 and the destination is your computers IP address 192.51.100.15.
5.	After the source and destination IP addresses, there can be a number of additional details like the protocol, port number of the source, and flags. In the first line of the error log, the query identification number appears as: 35084. The plus sign after the query identification number indicates there are flags associated with the UDP message. The "A?" indicates a flag associated with the DNS request for an A record, where an A record maps a domain name to an IP address. The third line displays the protocol of the response message to the browser: "ICMP," which is followed by an ICMP error message.
6.	The error message, "udp port 53 unreachable" is mentioned in the last line. Port 53 is a port for DNS service. The word "unreachable" in the message indicates the UDP message requesting an IP address for the domain "www.yummyrecipesforme.com" did not go through to the DNS server because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port.
7.	The remaining lines in the log indicate that ICMP packets were sent two more times, but the same delivery error was received both times. 


Now that you have captured data packets using a network analyzer tool, it is your job to identify which network protocol and service were 
impacted by this incident. Then, you will need to write a follow-up report.

### Provide a Summary of the Problem Found in the DNS and ICMP Traffic Log

The network protocol analyzer logs show that port 53, which is used for DNS queries, is currently unreachable when attempting to access the secure employee background check website. Since DNS is essential for resolving domain names, this issue may be preventing the website from loading correctly. The cause could be a misconfiguration in the firewall or a problem with the DNS server itself. Additionally, this disruption could be a sign of a malicious attack targeting the DNS infrastructure or the web server to interrupt access.

### Explain Your Analysis of the Data and Provide at Least One Cause of the Incident

The incident occurred Earlier today, the Human Resources (HR) department reported that they were unable to access the background check web portal. In response, the network security team initiated an investigation using the tcpdump network analysis tool. During the analysis, logs indicated that port 53, the standard port for HTTPS traffic, was not reachable from within the network.
The issue appears to be affecting secure connections to the portal, and further investigation is underway to determine the underlying cause and restore full access. Immediate next steps include reviewing firewall configurations to check for any blocks on port 53 and coordinating with the system administrator responsible for the web server to assess for any signs of malicious activity or system compromise.
The HR team has raised a concern that a specific recent job applicant may be attempting to interfere with the background check process. Based on preliminary findings, the network security team is considering the possibility of a targeted attack intended to disrupt access to the portal
